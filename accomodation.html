    <h2>HISTORY OF THE INN</h2>
    <p>
        Ninety years ago, construction began on La Morada (“dwelling” in Spanish), the first building in what would become Rancho Santa Fe. Now known as The Inn at Rancho Santa Fe, “The Inn” to locals, it was then a guesthouse for prospective land buyers, a place to “put them up” while they looked at lots owned by the Santa Fe Land Improvement Company. The company, a subsidiary of the Santa Fe Railway, had bought up parcels, planting eucalyptus trees for railroad spikes. But as history has so often shown, not everything goes according to plan. The wood, the company discovered, was too soft to hold the spikes. It was on to plan B.
    </p>
    <p>
        That plan turned out to be fortuitous. It led to the master-planned community of Rancho Santa Fe, designed by Lilian Rice, a National City-born architect and U.C. Berkeley graduate, who would earn acclaim for her signature Spanish Colonial Revival style. Rice designed the village’s key commercial and residential buildings, many now considered so historically significant that they are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the decades The Inn has been a favorite destination for many years of famous and influential people.  In 1932, singer-actor Bing Crosby purchased one of Juan Osuna’s original adobes with 50 acres, and hired Lilian Rice as his architect. Legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright was married in the parlor of the Inn in 1928.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as the architecture of the missions tells a story about the history of California, so does Lilian Rice’s legendary design of The Inn. It is a perfect representation of old California charm and Rice's belief that true beauty lies in simplicity rather than ornateness. The Inn is a perfect reflection of Rice's dream - a place where time stands still amidst the simplistic, natural beauty that is Rancho Santa Fe.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
